I learned a little bit of HTML when I was younger. I had a Myspace profile and my cousin took me under her wing: she showed me how to change font size and make text bold, underline, and italicize. When I got older, I began using Tumblr and noticed those skills came in handy because Tumblr also allowed you to alter the code of your layout. I began practicing and learned to do even more. I began recognizing patterns and learned the basic outline of HTML. When I was in college, I made a website with square space and, with the little experience I had, I could personalize it more to my liking. Now, at my current job, I oversee our website and I’ve learned to customize it and anything I don’t know, I am able to google and implement myself.

If someone is learning to code HTML, I would recommend trying to practice reading HTML. If the person doesn’t have a website, Tumblr, or Myspace, they can still see the source code of any website. This will at least get them used to it and will seem less foreign when they begin learning it.
