I did my CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project scraping the national park website. The gem returns a list of national parks in a US state or territory chosen by the user. If the user wants to find out more about a park, a description of the park can be requested. While coding, my biggest problem, and something I need to work on, is knowing when to use require vs require_relative and add_dependency. For this, I followed along with the walkthrough. While working on this project, I got a lot of practice with git and github. This was one of my weaker areas, but I feel a lot more confident post-project. I am still confused on the difference between committing and push.
