When I was in middle school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life; however, since I was so young, I didn't worry about it too much. Once I entered high school, I began to worry even more. Then the day when I had to decide finally came: I was applying for college orientation and I was asked, "What major will you be pursuing?" I began to panic. Growing up I knew I was good at math but that did not narrow down much in terms of choosing a major. I began as a bioengineering major and later switched to a civil engineering major. Later, when I switched to statistics, I had to take "Intro to Programming" to satisfy a prerequisite. Out of all the classes I took in college, it was the only one I enjoyed. However, instead of pursuing programming, I ended up getting my bachelorâ€™s degree in finance. After graduating and finding a job, I realized I did not want to continue working in business and began considering going back to school when I found out about coding camps. After doing some research, I found Flatiron, earned a scholarship, and enrolled.
